# todo-list

## Description
This is my sixth project within the Full Stack JavaScript course from The Odin Project, continuing my coursework within the JavaScript chapter of the course. In this prompt response, I have built a web application which enables users to create projects with corresponding to-do lists incorporating tasks, which are characterized by name, description, due date, and priority level. In this project, I've continued to practice skills with webpack, continuing forward with building nearly the whole DOM in JS. I also started to incorporate SOLID design principles with this project, creating separate modules for different purposes following the single responsibility principle. For example, I have separate folders for app functionality and DOM manipulation, within which are multiple JS modules separated into similarly responsibility-based categories.

As I have in previous projects, I did work to continue honing both learned and new CSS skills, but that was not a priority in this project. Having done my best to get as clear a layout as possible, I will admit that this is not my most visually or aesthetically perfect project, recognizing that my priorities were more to practice skills focused on the functionality (or the backend) of the project instead. This is not a project which will be used to showcase my top skills, but rather to mark my learning progress and stand as evidence of my work toward building better skills.
